# Alzheimer :

According to Wiki - Alzheimer's disease (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer's, is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens.[2] It is the cause of 60â€“70% of cases of dementia.[2] The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events.[1] As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues.[1][2] As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society.[1] Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death.[10] Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.[7][11]

My great uncle has it and seeing up closely the struggle he and his family members go through have always been one of the reason for me wanting to contribute in this field.
His wife is always in state of underlying fear that due to his forgetfulness may harm himself unknowingly. Moreover his kids who live abroad, worry about 
them and wish for things to be a bit simpler and easier for this couple.

Based on my observation , the most important thing these patients need is companionship. They need some one to constantly remind them about there routine, different memories and people and someone who can detect their moods.

Thus, this is my attempt to keep learning different ways that may help Alzheimer patients. My research have helped me understand that there are many people trying to work for their betterment in ML/AI field.
I am trying to learn from these references  and build a path that may pave to a better application in future.
